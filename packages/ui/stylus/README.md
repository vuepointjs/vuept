# VuePoint.js - Stylus CSS Preprocessor Files

[VuePoint.js](https://github.com/vuepointjs/vuept) (VP) leverages Vue and Vuetify for front-end development. Vuetify is based on
Stylus, and therefore VP comes with Stylus files to customize Vuetify.

## CSS Selectors

VP defines [interpolated CSS selector](http://stylus-lang.com/docs/interpolation.html#selector-interpolation) variables that provide a
simple, reliable layer of abstraction/indirection on top of the Vuetify DOM elements. Using these selectors allows VP to remain
independent of future Vuetify changes, and to specify styles in a more self-documenting manner.

To use the selector variables, simply place them in curly braces anywhere that a CSS selector can appear.

## Stay Tuned

More information on the design and implementation of the VP styles is coming soon!
