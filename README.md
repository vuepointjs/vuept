# VuePoint.js

Vue-powered, SharePoint-like Business Suite Toolkit.

# What's the *Point*?

This Toolkit aims to make it easy to create custom [Line-of-Business web apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_business) that slot into the *Microsoft Office 365* ecosystem.

# What it's *not*

This project, though Vue-powered, is not to be confused with [*The Vue Point*](https://medium.com/the-vue-point), the official Vue.js Blog.

The name of this project is clearly just a play on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [SharePoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/sharepoint-online-collaboration-software). But it's definitely *not* intended to compete somehow with SharePoint. SharePoint is primarily about creating Intranets to facilitate *ad hoc collaboration and communication*.

**VuePoint.js** is *not* about that at all.

# What it *is*

VuePoint.js is about creating *mission-critical line-of-business apps* that just happen to borrow some UI/UX ideas from SharePoint and that can single sign-on with an Office 365 tenancy.

Time to decide where you go next. You can jump into the [**Getting Started**](GETTING-STARTED.md) instructions, or continue reading some additional background information below before committing to that.

# Background

The category of apps we're focused on here is sometimes referred to as *forms over data*, or perhaps [*data collection systems*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection_system). The focus is squarely on **quadrant 1** of the following diagram.

See [here](https://medium.com/@SteveLathrop/build-your-business-website-in-the-right-neighborhood-41eaea011404) for a detailed discussion of this diagram and the quadrants depicted. And for more general information about this category of business app, see: [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete), the ["Active record pattern"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern), and [some SharePoint history and related information](https://bobchiverton.com/2018/07/16/the-sharepoint-trip-to-modern-are-we-there-yet-part-2/).
